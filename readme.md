# Capcom ZN-2 stereo breakout board

The ZN-2 stereo breakout board is a custom PCB that connects to a ZN-2 audio header and provide line level stereo output. The attenuation circuit is based on the Sanwa VC-J [documented here](http://www.neo-geo.com/forums/showthread.php?172861-A-different-attenuation-circuit).

It's mounted by a single standoff, and is supported by the connector that sits on the stereo header.

## Assembly

To assemble the board, soldering experience is needed. Parts in the BOM must be acquired, and a custom PCB printed. The PCB can be printed from anywhere, but a link is provided to purchase from OSH Park for convenience. If you have any questions regarding the installation or purchase please create an issue.

## Installation

For ZN-2 games, the stereo/mono switch next to the volume pot must be set to stereo. The game also needs to be set to stereo in the test menu.

The BOM includes M3 standoff and screws. Depending on your PCB standoffs, these might not be the right size, please double check!
